--Pig dice game (greedy pig) rules--

Each turn the player rolls two dice. If the player gets 1 on any of the dice he earns nothing and another player gets his turn. On getting 2-6 on the dice, player's sum is being added to his round score, until he decides to stash his current score. If the player stashed his score, the other player gets his turn.  If a player gets 6 on any dice twice in a row, the player loses all the points from his current and overall scores. The player who got 100 (or more) points wins the game.
